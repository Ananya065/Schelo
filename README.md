# 🗺️ Schelo (Beta)
**Turn your to-do list into a journey.**

Schelo is a minimalist, beginner-friendly productivity tool that gamifies your daily tasks. Instead of a boring vertical list, Schelo visualizes your goals as a **path of milestones**. As you complete tasks, you move forward along the map toward your finish line.

## ✨ Features
* **The Path View:** Visualizes your day as a horizontal journey rather than a chore list.
* **Single-Task Focus:** Highlights your current "Milestone" to reduce overwhelm.
* **Progress Tracking:** Watch your marker move from the start to the finish line in real-time.
* **Local Persistence:** Uses Browser LocalStorage to ensure your journey is saved even if you refresh the page.
* **Responsive Design:** Dark mode by default, optimized for both desktop and mobile browsers.

## 🚀 How It Works
1. **Plant Flags:** Type your tasks into the input field to create "Milestones" on your map.
2. **Focus:** The app highlights only your current active task.
3. **Advance:** Click "Move Forward" to complete a task and watch your progress marker slide to the next point.
4. **Finish:** Reach the end of your path to complete your daily journey!

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
This is a pure frontend project built to demonstrate core web development concepts:
* **HTML5:** Semantic structure.
* **CSS3:** Custom animations, Flexbox layouts, and Dark Mode styling.
* **JavaScript (ES6):** State management, DOM manipulation, and LocalStorage integration.

## 📂 Installation & Setup
No installation is required!
1. Clone this repository or download the files.
2. Ensure `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` are in the same folder.
3. Open `index.html` in any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

## 👨‍💻  Learning Objectives
Building Schelo helped me practice:
* Managing application **State** (tracking current vs. upcoming tasks).
* **Event Listeners** to handle user interactions.
* Working with **JSON** to store data in the browser.
* Creating a **Dynamic UI** that updates without page refreshes.
